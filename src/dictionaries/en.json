The most common types of fuels used in cars include:\nGasoline (Petrol): Gasoline-powered cars are the most prevalent globally. They use internal combustion engines that run on gasoline, which is a refined petroleum product. Gasoline engines are available in various configurations, including regular unleaded, premium, and diesel engines.\nDiesel: Diesel engines use diesel fuel, which is different from gasoline. These engines operate on compression ignition, where the fuel-air mixture is compressed until it ignites. Diesel engines tend to be more fuel-efficient than gasoline engines, especially in larger vehicles like trucks and some passenger cars.\nElectric: Electric cars use electricity stored in batteries to power an electric motor, eliminating the need for traditional fuel. They are considered zero-emission vehicles, as they produce no tailpipe emissions while driving. Electric cars are becoming increasingly popular due to their environmental benefits.",
